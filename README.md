> 🧩 Project 12 — TripleTen Software Engineering Program

WTWR Backend is a server-side application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
It powers the “What to Wear?” app by handling user data, clothing items, and REST API endpoints, while enforcing strong data validation and structured error handling.

## 🧠 About the Project

This project focused on building a full backend REST API from scratch.
The goal was to develop a clean, organized server application that can create, store, retrieve, and validate data through Express routes and MongoDB models.
You also learned how to apply Airbnb ESLint rules, use Mongoose schemas, and structure controllers for scalable backend architecture.

## 🎨 Project Features

✅ **REST API Endpoints** — users & clothing item management
✅ **MongoDB + Mongoose Models** — structured data schemas
✅ **Express Routing — modular** and organized
✅ **Centralized Error Handling** — validation, not found, and server errors
✅ **Validator.js** — URL validation
✅ **ESLint (Airbnb Base)** — Prettier for clean, consistent code
✅ **Local MongoDB** — Integration at mongodb://localhost:27017/wtwr_db

## 💡 Key Concepts Practiced

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **REST API Design** | Design	Built structured, resource-based endpoints |
| **Express.js** | Controllers	Separated logic into clean controller files |
| **Mongoose Schemas** | Created user & item models with validation |
| **Error Handling** | Middleware	Implemented centralized error responses |
| **Routing Structure** | Used separate route files for clarity |
| **Linting (Airbnb)** | Wrote standardized, professional-quality code |

## ✨ Reflection

This project strengthened your backend development skills by teaching you how to:
Organize a full Express app into controllers, models, and routes
Create flexible and validated MongoDB schemas
Implement scalable error handling patterns
Maintain clean, readable code with ESLint & Prettier
Test REST endpoints using tools like Postman
By completing this sprint, you've taken a major step toward understanding how modern backends are structured in real production apps.
